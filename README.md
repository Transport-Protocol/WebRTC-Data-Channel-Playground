# WebRTC Datachannel Playground
This playground contains some testing tools for WebRTC Datachannels. Some are useful measurement tools, some are just demos and some may not work.

## Our Tools
### [Netperfmeter](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nplab/WebRTC-Datachannel-Playground/master/netperfmeter/netperfmeter.html)
Netperfmeter is a perfomance meter for the WebRTC datachannels. It simultaneously transmits unidirectional data via datachannels to an endpoint and measures the resulting channel bandwidths.

This tool is port of Thomas Dreibholz's [Netperfmeter](https://www.uni-due.de/~be0001/netperfmeter/).

### [Browsertests](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nplab/WebRTC-Datachannel-Playground/master/conformance-tests/conformance-tests.html)
Browsertests are used to check the implementation of WebRTC datachannels via a collection of severel tests.

### [Stresstest](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nplab/WebRTC-Datachannel-Playground/master/stresstest/stresstest.html)
Stresstest to create multiple local Peer-Connections containing multiple Datachannels which are sending messages.

### [Gyrocolor](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nplab/WebRTC-Datachannel-Playground/master/gyrocolor/gyrocolor.html)
If available, the client changes the servers background color in dependence of its gyro-sensor values.

### [Speedtest](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nplab/WebRTC-Datachannel-Playground/master/speedtest/speedtest.html)
Speedtest, runtime and message-size are configurable.
