# WebRTC Datachannel Playground
This playground contains some testing tools for WebRTC Datachannels. Some are useful measurement tools - some are just demos.

## Demo
http://webrtc.weinrank.net

## Netperfmeter
Netperfmeter is a perfomance meter for the WebRTC datachannels. It simultaneously transmits unidirectional data via datachannels to an endpoint and measures the resulting channel bandwidths.

## Browsertests
Browsertests are used to check the implementation of WebRTC datachannels via a collection of severel tests.

## Stresstest
Stresstest to create multiple local Peer-Connections containing multiple Datachannels which are sending messages.

## Gyrocolor
If available, the clients changes the servers background color in dependence of its gyro-sensor values.

## Feedback
We like feedback! :)
