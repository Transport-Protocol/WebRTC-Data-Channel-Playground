# WebRTC Datachannel Playground
This playground contains some testing tools for WebRTC Datachannels. Some are useful measurement tools - some are just demos.

## Demo

## Our Tools
#### Netperfmeter
Netperfmeter is a perfomance meter for the WebRTC datachannels. It simultaneously transmits unidirectional data via datachannels to an endpoint and measures the resulting channel bandwidths.

This tool is port of Thomas Dreibholz's [Netperfmeter](https://www.uni-due.de/~be0001/netperfmeter/).

#### Browsertests
Browsertests are used to check the implementation of WebRTC datachannels via a collection of severel tests.

#### Stresstest
Stresstest to create multiple local Peer-Connections containing multiple Datachannels which are sending messages.

#### Gyrocolor
If available, the clients changes the servers background color in dependence of its gyro-sensor values.
